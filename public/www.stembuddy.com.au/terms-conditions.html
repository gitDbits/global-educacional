My son really liked it and enjoyed this workshop. Now every day my son creates and show me some program what he made on computer. Highly recommended.</p>

                                    <p>I myself a teacher and Stembuddy coding classes instructor is knowledgeable and politely interacting with children. Also, best part is their curriculum is aligned with victorian curriculum, children learnt about basic programming structures and how to use software to make programs and solve problems, worked around literacy, maths and practical scenarios. It was wonderful and extremely organized coding classes for primary school children. I would recommend Stembuddy coding for children who are really interested in learning about programming and robotics.</p>

                                    <p>My daughter who is in Grade 3 learnt Scratch programming. She enjoyed a lot learning programming at this age. After she got training with stembuddy, she feels confident making her own programs and share it with me. It was nice study material has been provided to children to follow instructions and make programs. I am looking forward to enroll her in a class room based learning when they start again in council library.</p>

They are challenged with extra resources in order to get a better understanding. It's definitely value for money with good quality program. I'm more than happy with my son's progress .</p>

Now he can make his own game and program it on his own way with the help of Scratch Jr software. He wanted to do further coding programming and wants to experience robots what stembuddy has. I will wait for face-to-face classes when it will open in Melbourne.</p>

Now she is able to make her own games and stories in Scratch Jr. She spent a good time learning something productive which will help her to learn future computer languages. My daughter really liked this online workshop. I would like her to join stembuddy's classroom based workshop again, when they they will schedule in near future. I would recommend STEMBUDDY for children or schools who really interested to learn programming and experience about robotics in early years of schooling. Thanks to teacher from Allegra.</p>

Homework is provided which includes a couple of coding exercises to review what was learned in class. Ash communicates well with the children, finding fun ways to challenge them to find solutions to their coding exercises whilst patiently helping along. Parents queries are answered promptly.</p>
